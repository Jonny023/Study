# sql分页

## mysql

```sql
select * from test limit 0,2;
select * from test limit 2 offset 0;
```

## oracle

```sql
SELECT * FROM  DEMO WHERE rownum BETWEEN 1 AND 3;
SELECT * FROM  bi.DEMO WHERE rownum <= 3;

-- 无order排序【推荐】
SELECT * FROM (SELECT ROWNUM AS rowno, t.* FROM  DEMO t WHERE rownum <= 3) WHERE rowno >=1;

-- 有order排序
SELECT * FROM (
		SELECT ROWNUM AS rowno, t.* 
		FROM (
            SELECT d.* FROM DEMO d WHERE d.age >= 18 ORDER BY d.age
        ) t 
		WHERE ROWNUM <= 20
	) tt 
WHERE tt.rowno >=2;
```

## sqlserver

```sql
-- row_number() over()
select * from (select *,(ROW_NUMBER() over(order by id)) rn from student) t where rn between 1 and 2;

-- sql2012+
select * from student order by create_time offset 0 rows fetch next 2 rows only;

-- sql2012-
select * from student where id not in (select top 0 id from student) order by create_time;
```

## hive

> 通过`ROW_NUMBER()`行号实现分页，下表从`0`开始

```sql
select * from (select *,(ROW_NUMBER() over(order by id)) rn from test_sh) t where rn between 1 and 2;
```

## postgresql

```sql
SELECT * FROM student limit 1 offset 0;

-- 行号 row_number() over()
select * from (
	select *,(row_number() over(order by age)) as rn from student
) t where t.rn between 1 and 2;
```
