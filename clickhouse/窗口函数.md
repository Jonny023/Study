# 窗口函数

[参考地址](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/docs/en/sql-reference/window-functions/index.md#experimental-window-function)

> 从clickhouse 21.1.3开始支持窗口函数，但是低版本默认没有启用，可以通过查询参数中临时启用` SETTINGS allow_experimental_window_functions = 1`

```sql
SELECT
	formatDateTime(event_time,' %Y-%m-%d') as days,
	count(user_id) as uv,
	any(uv) over (order by uv asc ROWS BETWEEN 12 PRECEDING AND 12 PRECEDING) as prev_year,
	any(uv) over (order by uv asc ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) as prev_month
FROM
	mytable
group by days order by days SETTINGS allow_experimental_window_functions = 1;
```
